# Feedback for Student

**Guided Questions and Suggestions:**

1.  **Autograder Output Analysis:** 

    *   Look at the Autograder output for both `product.c` and `time_conversion.c`. Identify the specific errors or warnings reported by the autograder.
2.  **Implicit Function Declaration Warning:**

    *   For the `time_conversion.c` file, you see an implicit declaration warning for the `atoi` function. This is because the compiler doesn't know what `atoi` does without seeing its definition.
    *   To fix this, include the `<stdlib.h>` header at the beginning of your code to declare the `atoi` function.

        ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Rest of your code...
```

3.  **Variable Declaration and Usage:**

    *   For both `product.c` and `time_conversion.c`, there are issues with variable declaration and usage.
    *   In the `product.c` file, you have an undeclared variable `product`. Declare it before using it in your code.

        ```c
int product = 1;
```

    *   Also, for the `product.c` file, the array index is out of bounds because you are trying to access `numbers[10]`, but your array only has 10 elements (index 0-9).
    *   Change the loop condition in the `for` loop to `i < 10`.

        ```c
// Reading numbers from the file
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
```

4.  **Product Calculation:**

    *   In the `product.c` file, you are trying to calculate the product of all numbers in the array but you're not multiplying them together correctly.
    *   You should multiply each number with the current product.

        ```c
// Calculate the product
int product = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    product *= numbers[i];
}
```

5.  **Output Format:**

    *   For both files, you need to format your output according to the specifications.
    *   In `product.c`, print the sum and product on separate lines.

        ```c
printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
printf("Product: %d\n", product);
```

6.  **README.md Update:**

    *   Don't forget to update your README.md file with your name before submitting your assignment.
7.  **Submission:**

    *   Make sure you submit the correct files, including `product.c` and `time_conversion.c`, along with any other required files or changes as specified in the instructions.

**Example Code for Both Files:**

Here's an example code that fixes the issues mentioned above:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to convert minutes into hours and minutes
void timeConversion(int minutes) {
    int hours = minutes / 60;
    int mins = minutes % 60;

    printf("%d hours %d minutes\n", hours, mins);
}

int main() {
    // Test the time conversion function
    timeConversion(245);

    return 0;
}

// Function to calculate sum and product of numbers in an array
void calculateSumAndProduct(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    long long product = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
        product *= arr[i];
    }

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Product: %lld\n", product);
}

int main() {
    int numbers[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    calculateSumAndProduct(numbers, 10);

    return 0;
}
```
