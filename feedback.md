# Feedback for Student

Here are some guided questions and helpful suggestions for each student code based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. What is causing the implicit declaration warning? 
   - The `atoi` function is used but not declared anywhere in the code.

2. How to fix this warning?
   - Add the necessary `#include <stdlib.h>` directive at the top of the file to include the standard library where `atoi` is defined.

**product.c:**

1. What are the errors occurring on lines 17 and 27? 
   - There is a missing comma after the `int sum = 0;` declaration.
   - The variable `product` is used before it's declared.

2. How to fix these errors?
   - Add a comma after the `int sum = 0;` declaration.
   - Declare the `product` variable before using it.

3. What is causing the test to fail? 
   - The product calculation is incorrect due to the missing declaration of the `product` variable and incorrect multiplication logic.

4. How to fix this issue?
   - Move the `int product = 1;` declaration above the loop where `numbers[i]` is multiplied by it.
   - Use the correct formula for calculating the product of numbers in an array, which involves multiplying all elements together.

5. What should be checked in the test script? 
   - The output of the program should match the expected values provided in the README.md file.

6. How to fix this issue?
   - Ensure that the `product` variable is correctly calculated and printed out.
   - Check if the input numbers are within the range specified (1-20) and handle any potential errors.
