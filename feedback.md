# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student:

**Product.c:**

1. Look at lines 13-14 in the code. The error message indicates that there is an expected ';' before 'while'. However, there is no 'while' loop in this code. Check if you have any other loops or conditional statements that might be causing this issue.
2. On line 6, the variable 'binRep' is declared but not used. Remove this declaration as it seems unnecessary for this program.
3. In the for loop on lines 21-28, there are errors in the syntax. Check if you have any typos or misplaced brackets/parentheses.

**Time_conversion.c:**

1. The error message indicates that there is an expected ';' before 'for'. However, there is no 'for' loop in this code. Check if you have any other loops or conditional statements that might be causing this issue.
2. On line 24, the program prints '\n', which is a newline character. This might not be what you intended. Check if you need to print anything else before returning 0.

**Common issues:**

1. Make sure to check your file paths and command line arguments in both programs. The Autograder Output suggests that there are errors with file paths or command line arguments.
2. Review the syntax of your loops and conditional statements. The error messages suggest that there might be typos or misplaced brackets/parentheses.

**General suggestions:**

1. Make sure to test your programs thoroughly before submitting them. Run them on different inputs and check their output.
2. Check the Autograder Output carefully for any errors or warnings. Address these issues before submitting your assignment.
3. Review the Professor Instructions and make sure you understand what is expected of you in both programming tasks.
