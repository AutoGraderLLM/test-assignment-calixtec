# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and helpful suggestions for each student code:

**time_conversion.c:**

* The error message indicates that the `atoi` function is not declared. Make sure to include the `stdlib.h` header file at the top of your code to declare this function.
* The program seems to be working fine, but it's always a good practice to check for errors and handle them properly.

**product.c:**

* There are two errors in this code:
	+ The variable `product` is not declared before being used. Add `int product = 1;` after the array declaration.
	+ The product calculation is incorrect because it's multiplying all numbers together instead of calculating their product. Change `product *= numbers[i];` to `product *= numbers[i];` (no change needed).
* However, there seems to be an issue with the expected output. Make sure to double-check your calculations and expected results.
* Also, consider adding some error handling in case the file cannot be opened or read correctly.

**General Suggestions:**

* Make sure to check the return values of `fopen`, `fscanf`, and other functions to handle potential errors.
* Consider using more descriptive variable names instead of single-letter variables like `i` and `x`.
* Think about how you can improve your code's readability, maintainability, and performance.
