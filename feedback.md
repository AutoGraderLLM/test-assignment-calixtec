# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student:

**Time Conversion (task 1)**

* The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the `main` function of `time_conversion.c`. Look at line 13 and check if there is an extra semicolon or any other syntax issue.
* The variable `binRep` is declared but not used. Remove this declaration to avoid the warning.
* There is another syntax error on line 20, where the loop condition is missing a semicolon. Add a semicolon after `i >= 0`.
* The expected output for the test case with input `-6340` does not match the actual output. Check if the conversion logic is correct and if there are any issues with integer overflow.

**Product (task 2)**

* The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the `main` function of `product.c`. Look at line 13 and check if there is an extra semicolon or any other syntax issue.
* There is another syntax error on line 20, where the loop condition is missing a semicolon. Add a semicolon after `i >= 0`.
* The array size for `numbers` is set to 11, but only 10 values are read from the file. Change the loop condition to `i < 10` to avoid accessing an out-of-bounds index.
* The expected output for the test case does not match the actual output. Check if the sum and product calculations are correct.

**General Suggestions**

* Make sure to check all command line arguments and handle any errors that may occur when opening or reading files.
* Use meaningful variable names and comments to improve code readability.
* Review the Professor Instructions and make sure to follow all requirements for this assignment.
