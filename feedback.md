# Feedback for introllm-LeonardAlmeida

Here are some guided questions based on the provided student code and professor instructions:

**i2b.c:**

1. What is the issue with the while loop condition in the given code? How can it be fixed?

2. The variable `binRep` is declared but not used anywhere in the code. What is its purpose, and how can it be utilized effectively?

3. In the for loop that prints the binary representation, the starting index is set to `N - 1`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. How should the starting index be set instead?

4. The code does not handle negative numbers correctly. What changes need to be made to accommodate both positive and negative integers?

5. The expected output for a random input number (-28117) does not match the actual output. What might be the reason, and how can it be corrected?

**i2h.c:**

1. The code uses `atoi` function to convert the command line argument to an integer. However, this function may throw errors if the input is not a valid integer. How can this issue be addressed?

2. The variable `hex` has a fixed size of 9 characters, which might not be sufficient for all possible hexadecimal representations. What could be done to ensure that the output always fits within the allocated space?

3. The code prints the hexadecimal representation with spaces between the digits, but according to the problem statement, there should be no spaces. How can this requirement be met?

4. The expected output for a random input number (-28117) matches the actual output in terms of hexadecimal representation. However, the actual output is different from the expected one. What might be the reason, and how can it be corrected?
