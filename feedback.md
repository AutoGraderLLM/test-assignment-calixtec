# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions to help you address the issues:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. What is the purpose of the `atoi` function in C? How can you resolve the implicit declaration warning?
2. The program seems to be working correctly for the test case, but what if the input is not a valid integer? How can you handle such cases?

**product.c:**

1. What is the issue with the line `int product = 1;` and how can you fix it?
2. Why is there an error message about `'product' undeclared` when trying to calculate the product of the integers? How can you resolve this issue?
3. The program seems to be failing for some test cases, but what if the input file does not contain exactly 10 lines or values between 1 and 20? How can you handle such cases?

To address these issues, consider revising your code according to the Professor Instructions. Make sure to:

* Declare variables before using them
* Handle potential errors and edge cases
* Follow the specified format for outputting results

By addressing these issues, you should be able to resolve the Autograder Output warnings and errors, and ensure that your programs pass all test cases.
