# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student:

1.  **time_conversion.c:**
    *   The warning message indicates that the `atoi` function is being used without a declaration. Make sure to include the `<stdlib.h>` header file at the top of the code to declare `atoi`.
    *   Also, ensure that the program handles cases where the input is not a valid integer.
2.  **product.c:**
    *   The error messages indicate that there are missing commas and that the variable `product` is being used before it's declared. Add commas after each variable declaration to separate them correctly.
    *   Move the declaration of `product` above its usage in the for loop.
3.  **General Suggestions:**
    *   Always check the return values of file operations (e.g., `fopen`, `fscanf`) to handle potential errors.
    *   Use meaningful variable names and follow a consistent coding style throughout the code.

By addressing these issues, the student should be able to resolve the compilation errors and produce the correct output for both programs.
