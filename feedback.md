# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and helpful suggestions for each student code:

**Product Code (product.c)**

1. The error message indicates that there is an expected comma or semicolon before the `int` declaration of `product`. What does this mean in terms of C syntax?
2. The Autograder Output also reports that `product` is undeclared at line 27. How can you fix this issue?

**Time Conversion Code (time_conversion.c)**

1. The Autograder Output indicates a warning about an implicit declaration of the `atoi` function. What does this mean, and how can you resolve the issue?
2. The program seems to be working correctly in terms of output, but there is no error handling for cases where the input cannot be converted to an integer or when the conversion fails. How can you add basic error handling to make the program more robust?

**General Suggestions**

1. Make sure to check the Professor Instructions carefully and understand what each programming task requires.
2. Review the Autograder Output carefully to identify specific errors and warnings, and use these as a starting point for debugging your code.
3. Use online resources or C documentation to look up any functions or syntax that you are not familiar with.
4. Consider using a code editor or IDE with built-in debugging tools to help you identify and fix issues in your code.
