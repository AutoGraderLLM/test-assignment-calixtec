# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions for the student:

1. What is the issue with the line `i = 0` in the code? According to the Autograder Output, what error message does it produce?

2. The variable `binRep` is declared but not used. How can you fix this warning according to the Professor Instructions?

3. In the for loop, the condition `i < N` should be `i >= 5` and also the increment operator should be `-=` instead of `-`. What changes do you need to make here?

4. The variable `n` is used before it's assigned a value in the while loop. According to the Professor Instructions, what should be the initial condition for `i`?

5. In the while loop, the expression `binRep[i] = n % 2` assigns a value to `binRep[i]`. However, according to the Autograder Output, there is an error message about expecting a semicolon before `while`. What change do you need to make here?

6. The line `printf("\n");` should be outside the for loop according to the Professor Instructions. Where exactly should it be placed?

7. In the i2h.c file, what changes are required to convert the integer into its corresponding hexadecimal representation? According to the Professor Instructions, what is the expected length of the hex array and how should it be printed?

8. The i2h.c file has a warning about expecting an identifier or '(' before 'for'. What change do you need to make here?

9. In the i2h.c file, the variable `hex` is declared with a fixed size of 9 characters. However, according to the Professor Instructions, it should be an array of characters with a length of 8. How can you modify this?
