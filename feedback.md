# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and helpful suggestions for each student code:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. What is the issue with the `atoi` function in this program? According to the Autograder Output, what warning message does it produce?

Answer: The `atoi` function is not declared in this program. To fix this, you need to include the `<stdlib.h>` header file at the beginning of your code.

2. What is the expected output format for this program according to Professor Instructions? How does your current output match up with this format?

Answer: Your current output is missing the hours and minutes parts. You should separate the calculation of hours and remaining minutes into two separate variables and then print them in the desired format.

**product.c:**

1. What are the issues with the `int product = 1;` line in your program? According to the Autograder Output, what error message does it produce?

Answer: The `int product = 1;` line is missing a semicolon at the end. To fix this, you need to add a semicolon after the assignment.

2. What is the issue with the `product` variable being used before it's declared? According to the Autograder Output, what error message does it produce?

Answer: The `product` variable is used in the line `product *= numbers[i];`, but it's not declared anywhere in the program. To fix this, you need to declare the `product` variable as an integer before using it.

3. What is the expected output for this program according to Professor Instructions? How does your current output match up with this?

Answer: Your current output is missing the sum and product parts. You should calculate the sum of the integers in the array and print it on one line, followed by the product of the integers on the next line.

**General Suggestions:**

1. Make sure to include all necessary header files at the beginning of your code.
2. Check for any implicit function declarations or missing semicolons.
3. Verify that your variables are declared before they're used in the program.
4. Review the expected output format and make sure your program produces the correct result.

By addressing these issues, you should be able to fix the errors in your code and produce the correct output for both programs.
