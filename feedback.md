# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for each student code:

**time_conversion.c:**

1. The autograder output shows a warning about an implicit declaration of the `atoi` function. This is because the `atoi` function is declared in the `stdlib.h` library, which is not included in your code.
2. To fix this issue, you need to add the following line at the top of your file: `#include <stdlib.h>`.
3. The program seems to be working correctly and passing all tests.

**product.c:**

1. The autograder output shows two errors related to the `product` variable. This is because the `product` variable is declared after it's being used.
2. To fix this issue, you need to move the declaration of the `product` variable to before its first use.
3. Additionally, the program seems to be reading only 10 numbers from the file instead of all 11. This might be due to an off-by-one error in the loop condition.
4. You should also check if the product is within a reasonable range (e.g., not too large) to avoid overflow issues.

Some general suggestions:

1. Make sure to include all necessary header files and libraries in your code.
2. Check for potential errors, such as file I/O or arithmetic operations, to ensure robustness.
3. Use meaningful variable names and comments to make your code easier to understand.
4. Consider adding input validation and error handling to handle unexpected inputs or file issues.

By addressing these issues and suggestions, you should be able to fix the errors in your code and get it working correctly.
