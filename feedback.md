# Feedback for Student

Here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions:

**Time Conversion Code (time_conversion.c)**

1. The Autograder Output shows a warning about an implicit function declaration of `atoi`. What is `atoi` in C, and how can you fix this warning?
2. The program seems to be working correctly, but the output format is not exactly as specified. How can you modify the code to print the result in the format **X hours Y minutes**?
3. Make sure to include the necessary header file for `atoi` by adding `#include <stdlib.h>` at the top of the code.

**Product Code (product.c)**

1. The Autograder Output shows two errors related to variable declarations and usage. What are the specific issues, and how can you fix them?
2. In C, variables must be declared before they are used. Make sure to move the declaration of `int product` above its usage.
3. The program is reading 10 integers from the file but only using the first 9 in the calculation. How can you modify the code to use all 10 integers?
4. Consider adding error handling for cases where the file cannot be opened or read correctly.

**General Suggestions**

1. Review the Professor Instructions and make sure you understand the requirements of both tasks.
2. Use a consistent coding style throughout your files, including indentation, spacing, and naming conventions.
3. Make sure to include all necessary header files and libraries in your code.
4. Test your code thoroughly with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.
