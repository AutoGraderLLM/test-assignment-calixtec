# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and helpful suggestions for each student code:

**Product Code:**

1. What is the expected declaration of the `product` variable? 
   ```c
int product = 1;
```
   However, in your code, it seems like you have declared two variables with the same name but different types (`int` and no type). This might be causing issues.

2. Why are there errors related to the `product` variable being undeclared? 
   It's likely because of the issue mentioned above. You need to declare `product` as an integer before using it.

3. What is the expected output for the given input numbers?
   The expected output should be:
   ```
Sum: 92
Product: 1380188160
```
   However, your code seems to be printing incorrect values.

4. Are there any issues with file handling in your code? 
   Yes, you are closing the file after reading from it, but you haven't checked if `fscanf` was successful before that. This might cause issues if there's an error.

**Time Conversion Code:**

1. What is the expected behavior for the program when it encounters a non-integer input?
   The program should print an error message and exit with a non-zero status code.

2. Why are there warnings related to implicit function declarations? 
   These warnings are because you're using `atoi` without declaring its return type or including the necessary header file (`stdlib.h`). 

3. Are there any issues with variable naming in your code?
   Yes, `total_minutes` could be renamed to something more descriptive like `minutes_to_convert`.

4. What is the expected output for a valid input of 245 minutes? 
   The program should print:
   ```
4 hours 5 minutes
```
   However, your code seems to be printing incorrect values.

By addressing these issues, you can improve the correctness and robustness of your code.
