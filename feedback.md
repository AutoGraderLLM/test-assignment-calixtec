# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for the student:

**Time Conversion Code (time_conversion.c)**

1. The error message indicates that the `atoi` function is not declared. Check if the `stdio.h` header file has been included at the top of the code.
2. The `atoi` function is used to convert a string to an integer. Make sure to check the return value to handle any potential errors.

**Product Code (product.c)**

1. There are two errors related to the `product` variable: it is not declared before use and there is an extra comma after the `int sum = 0;` line.
2. The array `numbers` has a fixed size of 11, but only 10 values are read from the file. This will cause undefined behavior. Consider using a dynamically allocated array or checking the return value of `fscanf` to handle errors.

**General Suggestions**

1. Review the Professor Instructions to ensure that all requirements have been met.
2. Check the Autograder Output for any other error messages or warnings that may indicate issues with the code.
3. Make sure to test the code thoroughly before submitting it, including checking the output format and handling potential errors.
4. Consider adding comments to explain the logic behind the code, especially in complex sections like the product calculation.
5. Review the README.md file to ensure that all required files are included and that the submission instructions have been followed correctly.
